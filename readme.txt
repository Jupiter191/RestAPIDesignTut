Initial setup involves creating a mongodb database on mLab.com, creating a user, then
installing express, mongoose, and body-parser with npm.

- Express is a simple server for nodejs.
- Mongoose is an Object Relational Mapper for interacting with mongodb.
- Body-parser is a middleware for parsing incoming http requests into easy to use req and res objects.
